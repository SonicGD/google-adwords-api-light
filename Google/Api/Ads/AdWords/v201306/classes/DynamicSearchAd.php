/**
 * Represents a dynamic search ad. This ad will have its headline and
 * destination URL auto-generated at serving time according to domain name
 * specific information provided by {@link DomainInfoExtension} linked at the
 * campaign level.
 *
 * <p>Auto-generated fields: headline and destination URL (may contain an optional
 * tracking URL)</p>
 *
 * <p>Required fields: description1, description2, displayUrl</p>
 *
 * <p>The URL field must contain at least one of the following placeholder tags
 * (URL parameters): {unescapedlpurl}, {escapedlpurl}, {lpurlpath}. If no URL is
 * specified, {unescapedlpurl} will be used as default.</p>
 *
 * <p>{unescapedlpurl} can only be used at the beginning of the URL field. It
 * will be replaced with the full landing page URL of the displayed ad. Extra query
 * parameters can be added to the end, e.g. "{unescapedlpurl}?lang=en".</p>
 *
 * <p>{escapedlpurl} will be replaced with the URL-encoded version of the full
 * landing page URL. This makes it suitable for use as a query parameter
 * value (e.g. "http://www.3rdpartytracker.com/?lp={escapedlpurl}") but
 * not at the beginning of the url field.</p>
 *
 * <p>{lpurlpath} will be replaced with the path and query part of the landing
 * page URL and can be added to a different URL, e.g.
 * "http://www.mygoodbusiness.com/tracking/{lpurlpath}".</p>
 *
 * <p>There are also special rules that come into play depending on whether the
 * destination URL uses local click tracking or third-party click tracking.<p>
 *
 * <p>For more information, see the article <a href="//support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?answer=2549100">Using dynamic tracking URLs</a>.
 * <span class="constraint AdxEnabled">This is disabled for AdX when it is contained within Operators: ADD, SET.</span>
