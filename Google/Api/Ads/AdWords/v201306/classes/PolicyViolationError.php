 * Violations of a single policy by two different strings is reported
 * as two separate instances of this class.
 *
 * e.g. If 'ACME' violates 'capitalization' and occurs twice in a text ad it
 * would be represented by one instance. If the ad also contains 'INC' which
 * also violates 'capitalization' it would be represented in a separate
 * instance.
