 * Applies the list of mutate operations (ie. add, set, remove):
 * <p>Add - Creates a new {@linkplain AdGroupAd ad group ad}. The
 * {@code adGroupId} must
 * reference an existing ad group. The child {@code Ad} must be sufficiently
 * specified by constructing a concrete ad type (such as {@code TextAd})
 * and setting its fields accordingly.</p>
 * <p>Set - Updates an ad group ad. Except for {@code status},
 * ad group ad fields are not mutable. Status updates are
 * straightforward - the status of the ad group ad is updated as
 * specified. If any other field has changed, it will be ignored. If
 * you want to change any of the fields other than status, you must
 * make a new ad and then delete the old one.</p>
 * <p>Remove - Removes the link between the specified AdGroup and
 * Ad.</p>
 *
 * @param operations The operations to apply.
 *
 * @return A list of AdGroupAds where each entry in the list is the result of
 * applying the operation in the input list with the same index. For an
 * add/set operation, the return AdGroupAd will be what is saved to the db.
 * In the case of the remove operation, the return AdGroupAd will simply be
 * an AdGroupAd containing an Ad with the id set to the Ad being deleted from
 * the AdGroup.
