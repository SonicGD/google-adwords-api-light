/**
 * A {@code BulkMutateJob} is essentially a mixed collection of mutate
 * operations from the following AdWords API campaign management services:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link CampaignService}</li>
 * <li>{@link CampaignTargetService}</li>
 * <li>{@link CampaignCriterionService}</li>
 * <li>{@link AdGroupService}</li>
 * <li>{@link AdGroupAdService}</li>
 * <li>{@link AdGroupCriterionService}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The mutate operations in a job's request are constructed in exactly the
 * same way as they are for synchronous calls to these services.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The mutate operations are grouped by their scoping entity in the
 * AdWords customer tree. Currently, mutate operations can be grouped either
 * by the customer or by their parent campaign. However, they cannot be
 * grouped both ways - some by customer and others by campaigns - in the same
 * job.</p>
 * 
 * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> A job may have no more than 500,000 mutate
 * operations in total, and no more than 10 different scoping campaigns.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The mutate operations must be packaged into containers called
 * {@code Operation Streams}, each tagged with the ID of the scoping entity of
 * its operations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>To facilitate the building of very large bulk mutate jobs, the operation
 * streams of a job can be submitted using multiple request parts. A job is
 * queued for processing as soon as it can be determined that all of its
 * request parts have been received.</p>
 * 
 * <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> A job may have no more than 100 request parts.
 * Each part may have no more than 25 operation streams and no more than 10,000
 * operations in total.</p>
